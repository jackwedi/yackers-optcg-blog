# Uta : use leader abilty earlier

Second time using teach in OP10, my list is still not definitive and the meta is still shifting post ban announcement.

## Round 1 - Green Uta ðŸ”´

I lost the dice roll and had to go first.

My game plan revolved around using Liberation (TODO) to limit board spam, but I misplayed
by dropping Doc Q (TODO) on my 3 DON turn. Since he stayed on the board, I couldnâ€™t
use Liberation, as my opponent maintained only a +1 character advantage until he
played Kid (TODO).

Another mistake I made was not canceling his On Play effects on his 4 DON turn. He played Brook (OP02-040) into Katakuri (ST16-003).
I could have handled Katakuri with Shiryu (TODO), but by that point, he was already ahead, and I couldnâ€™t catch up.

On my 7 DON turn, I tried to play Liberation (TODO) to clear his board, but he had three characters while I had two (Doc Q and Shiryu).

I managed to deal with one of his Kid (TODO), but he played another one.

During the final turn, I could have countered one of his attacks and possibly won on my next turn.
However, I thought I was safe and took one life, hoping to draw another Teach (TODO). I forgot about his event that re-stands a character or leader, and that cost me the game.

In the end, I made so many early misplays that it was too hard to recover.

## Round 2 - Green Uta ðŸŸ¢

Won the dice and choose to go second.
Tried to apply the same gamplan: Liberation (TODO).
Did leader ability starting at his 3 DON turn this time.
I managed to get lethal he had 2 active blockers 1 Gordon (TODO) and 1 Uta (TODO), 2 lifes and 6 or 7 cards in hand.
I had 4 attacks (Burgess 9K, Van Augur (TODO) 5K, Teach 12k and Leader), 10 Dons and a Blackhole (TODO).
Negated and KO'd his Gordon, thrashed all my hand to buff my Burgess (TODO) with a + 1000.
I almost threw but doing a simple 6K face with Van Augur but he chose to block with his Uta (TODO).

His hand was full of brick he had only 1K.

Usually I tend to play it safe and wait that I get a 100% lethal, but this time I understood correctly that I wouldnt be able to survive next turn so I had to go for it.

## Round 3 - Red Shanks ðŸ”´

Won the dice and choose to go second.

Before the tournament I already played against this player so I knew that he had the decklist with Ace from starter deck.
He managed to play his Ace early on and never attacked with him until the end when he got lethal with 10 cost Shanks from OP09.

I never found a way to handle his Ace, the only way would have been a Van Augur or Stronger + Black Hole but I did not have the cards early enough.

My gameplan against shanks is usually to aim for 2/3 Burgess for the late game, keep blackhole for Lucky Roux and use leader ability on his 7/8 DON turn to prevent a Ben Beckmann.
This time it did not work at all but the player told me that his decklist was designed to counter Teach.

# Thoughts

From these games I found that Doc Q was not as efficient as it was in OP09, I need to test a decklist without him to check.
From the recent decklists it seems that some players are dropping Doc Q and/or Laffite but it seems crazy.
