# # Teach Still Not Mastered

## Round 1 - Red Shanks ðŸ”´

Bad hand after mulligan: 2 Teach + 2 Kuzan.  
I used Shiryu to KO his cost-1 Uta on turn 4 DON!!  
He played cost-3 rush Zoro, and I couldnâ€™t counter it. 

He just went face and I could never recover.

## Round 2 - Yellow Enel ðŸŸ¢

Easy matchup, especially without Raigo.  
He could have won with rush Enel since he can stick to the board by trashing one of his life.  
But I KOâ€™d him with Van Augur and negated his effect using Blackhole.

## Round 3 - Blue Doflamingo ðŸŸ¢

Won the dice roll and went first.  
He focused on my life instead of the board but didnâ€™t have Perfume Femur.  
Van Augur and Doc Q carried the game â€” surprisingly, since I thought Liberation was the key piece, but I was never in a position where it wouldâ€™ve helped.

## Round 4 - Red/Green Smoker ðŸ”´

Won the dice roll and chose to go second â€” usually I go first, but someone told me it wasnâ€™t optimal, so I tried something new.  
Shiryu handled one of his Tashigi, but he managed to keep Smoker alive.  
Then he dropped Kid + Tashigi + Rosinante.  
I chose to clear his low-cost characters instead of playing Teach, which gave him the win.

## Round 5 - Purple Luffy ðŸ”´

I was confident in my gameplan: Liberation.  
He played around it by focusing on high-cost bodies.  
Sanji (cost 7) and Luffy (cost 9) â€” I had no answers in hand since I was digging for Liberation and Shiryu.

## Thoughts

Need to train more against **Shanks** and **Red/Green Smoker**.
