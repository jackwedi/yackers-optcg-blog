# Dofla Still Thriving?

Forgot my deckbox, but a player was kind enough to lend me his Dofla deck from OP10. First time playing Dofla.

---

## Round 1 - Purple Luffy ðŸŸ¢

Won the dice roll, went first.  
Easy hand to pilot: **Teach + Law**.  
He had to use *Gum-Gum* before reaching 10 DON.

---

## Round 2 - Red/Yellow Bello Betty ðŸŸ¢

Won the dice roll, went first.  
Went full face.  
Got lucky â€” he hit **0 triggers**.  

In hindsight, I shouldâ€™ve established the board before going face. Got lucky this time.

---

## Round 3 - Green Bonney ðŸ”´

Won the dice roll, went first.  
Went full face again â€” he had 10 cards in hand.  
He managed to establish the **Kid Fortress**: *Rosinante + Tashigi*.  
Misplayed by using *Red Roc* on **Kid** instead of directly on **Tashigi**.  

After the fortress setup, only **Pudding** couldâ€™ve helped, but it wasnâ€™t in the deck.

---

## Round 4 - Purple Luffy ðŸ”´

Played the matchup well until the final turn.  
Had **Boa** on board with 10 DONs. In hand: another Boa + counters.  
He had 2 cards in hand, 2 active DON, 1 life, a rested 7-cost Luffy, and a rested 9-cost Luffy.  

Sequence:
1. Swung 9k with Boa â€” he took the life.  
2. Swung 12k with leader â€” he *Gum-Gummed* and survived with just enough.

# Thoughts

Feels like I struggle adapting to unfamiliar matchups (like Bonney), and Iâ€™m still playing too aggressively.

**Dofla** still feels like a very strong deck.  
**Jinbe** was a sick card, but with **Law** and **Teach** keeps it solid.
