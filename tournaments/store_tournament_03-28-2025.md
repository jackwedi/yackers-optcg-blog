# Last time playing Enel before EB02

My main deck before Teach was Enel and I wanted to play him one last time before EB02. Always fun to have triggers.

## Round 1 - Red Green Smoker ðŸŸ¢

My main deck before Teach was Enel and I wanted to play him one last time before EB02. Always fun to have triggers.

## Round 2 - Red Yellow Bello Betty ðŸŸ¢

Went second.

Starve Mode ON.

On my first turn, I played Viola which let me check his life and re-order it. I placed his Karasu at the bottom and left a counter card with a trigger effect (playing a 5k character or less) as his second-to-last life.

My gameplan was simple: clear his board every turn before touching his life, making sure he could'nt trigger from his counter card.

I managed to starve him out until he had 0 cards in hand, but I never felt completely safe. If he had drawn a rusher, I could have lost as my hand was full of bricks.

Viola FTW.

## Round 3 - Green Yellow Yamato ðŸ”´

Went second.

Mulligan got two 0 cost counter and two Raigos - I think I lost right here.

I took the first double attack hit.
I managed to count the second and third banish double attack.

But then he played two Hody Jones back to back.
My hand was nothing but bricks, it was over.
I never had the cahnce to stabilize; the game was too fast, too soon.

## Round 4 - Purple Luffy ðŸŸ¢

New player playing with only a single starter deck.

## Round 5 - Red Shanks ðŸ”´

Played well no real missplays but he had three Shanks back to back and I had 0 triggers.

# Thoughts

Was a fun night the loss against Yamato was the hardest to take because I think I loss purely due to my starting hand.
