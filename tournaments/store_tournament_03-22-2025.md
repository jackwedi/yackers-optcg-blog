# Play it safe against yellow

First time using teach in OP10.

## Round 1 - Red Yellow Bello Betty ðŸŸ¢

NO SHOW

## Round 2 - Red Yellow Bello Betty ðŸ”´

I won the dice roll and chose to go second.

I played a perfect curve: Shiryu on 4 DON!! and Liberation on 6 DON!!. I managed to get my opponent down to 1 card in hand and 2 life.

At that point, I had two attacks left: Burgess at 9K and my Leader at 5K. I also had 1 life remaining and a Teach blocker.

I could have waited until the next turn to play another SR Teach and improve my odds of winning. But for some reason, I decided to attack with my 9K Burgess into his life and then a 5K attack from my Leader. Both attacks triggered characters that he played in response. These consecutive misplays ultimately cost me the game.

Looking back, the only way he could have won if I had waited was if his last card in hand or the one he drew on his turn was a rusher. When I asked him afterward, he told me he had no rushersâ€”only 2K counters.

## Round 3 - Green Purple Lim ðŸ”´

I won the dice roll and chose to go second.

Looking back, I think I misplayed the matchup by giving my opponent their preferred curve by not going first. They got their Secret Rare Zoro too quickly, and I had no way to remove it.

I considered playing Van Augur (-3) and Stronger (-2) followed by a Finger Pistol, but I found Stronger too late for it to be effective.

## Round 4 - Red Ace ðŸ”´

I lost the dice roll and went first.

Iâ€™m still unsure how to handle this matchup. My game plan was to rely on a big Burgess for the late game, but my hand was full of bricks while my opponent had an aggressive deck. Zoro and Luffy from ST-21 were especially effective against me.

# Thoughts

My biggest mistake was in Round 2â€”I still donâ€™t understand why I attacked life when I was ahead against a yellow deck. I need to play more safely in that matchup.
