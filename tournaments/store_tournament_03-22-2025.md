# 4 ROUNDS 23-03-2025

First time using teach in OP10.

## Round 1 - Red Yellow Bello Betty

NO SHOW

## Round 2 - Red Yellow Bello Betty

Won the dice and choose to go second.

Played perfect curve: Shiryu on 4 DON and Liberation on 6 DON.
Managed to get him to 1 card in hand and 2 lifes.
I had 2 attacks left a Burgess at 9K and Leader at 5K, 1 life, and 1 Teach blocker .

I could have simply waited for next turn to play another SR Teach and increase my odds of winning but I don't know why I still decided to do a 9K life with my Burgess and a 5K with leader which both triggered 2 characters he played. This successive missplays indeed made him win.

If we go back to the turn I could have waited, the only way he would have won the game was if his among the 1 card he had left or the card he drew during his turn there was a rusher. Of course when I asked him what he had in hand he had 0 rushers but only 2K counters.

## Round 3 - Green Purple Lim

Won the dice and choose to go second.

I think I don't have that matchup and gave him his preffered curve by going first.
He got his secret Zoro so fast, and I did not have any way of removing him.
I was thinking about doing Van Augur (-3) and Strong (-2) and then Finger Pistol but I found Stronger too late.

## Round 4 - Red Ace

Lost the dice and went first.

I don't know how to handle that matchup, my gameplan was to have big Burgess for late game but I had only bricks in hand and he had an aggro deck. Zoro and Luffy from ST-21 were very efficient against me.

# Thoughts

Major throwing made in Round 2, I still don't understand why I chose to attack life when ahead against a yellow deck.
