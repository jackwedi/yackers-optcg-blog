# Missplay on Luffy

Tried a decklist with 3 Laboons, 4 Shiryus, and only 1 Liberation, since the meta seems to be focused on 5-cost characters.

## Round 1 - Red Shanks ðŸ”´

Lost the dice roll, went first.

Early to mid game was correctly managed.  
Shiryu to clear Chopper is very powerful on curve.

Late game, I had 2 life, and he had 5.

Managed to bring him down to 1, but in doing so, I gave him the response he needed:  
Two 5-cost Luffys with Rush. He attacked with his leader for 5K, then two 6K attacks while I only had 1 Teach in hand and one on board.  
On the previous turn, I trashed a 2K to use the leader effectâ€”maybe I would have won if I had trashed Teach instead.

## Round 2 - Red Shanks ðŸŸ¢

Lost the dice roll, went first.

I had everything I needed: Kuzan, Burgess, Laboon.

Kuzan into Shiryu to clear his Chopper.  
Kuzan into Burgess.

Laboon + Van Augur + Doc Q cleared his Dragon.  
My Burgess was at 10K.  
He had 2 Shanks on board while I had 1 on board and 3 in hand.

Played Teach and had lethal thanks to Burgess and Teach at 11K and 12K.

## Round 3 - Purple Luffy ðŸ”´

Won the dice roll, went first.

I had all the cards needed to handle the matchup, but I misplayed by not anticipating the next turns properly.

For instance, I used my only Liberation on Bon Clay + Law (searcher), while I couldâ€™ve saved it to deal with the double Sanji he played later.

Very poor game sense hereâ€”I should never use Liberation on low-cost characters.

## Round 4 - Red/Green Smoker ðŸŸ¢

Lost the dice roll, went second.

Managed to clear 2 of his Smokers thanks to Laboon.  
Had a 2K blocker to protect Laboon.

He took life from 5K and 6K attacks.  
He played Kid with a Chopper blocker. I still had 4 life, and he had only 1 with 1 Don open.

I went for lethal by using Finger Pistol on his Chopper, followed by three 7K attacks.  
It workedâ€”he only had Hody Jones in hand.

## Thoughts

Playing only 1 Liberation didnâ€™t feel too little.  
I like this deck list more because Laboon allows me to KO 5-cost characters easily.

I might increase the number of Liberations or add another tech cardâ€”weâ€™ll see.

Need to work on a Purple Luffy game plan.
