# Pluffy is Getting Trickier

3 Laboons and 1 Catarina Devon in the decklist to test. Cut *This is My Era* (2) and *Blackhole* (2).

## Round 1 - Purple Luffy ðŸ”´

Won dice, went first.

Managed to use *Liberation* on Kamazo and San Goro.

Played Catarina, but he answered directly with the 5-cost event that KOs 6-cost or less and ramps.

He managed to keep 2 Luffy Taro on board, and the clearing of Catarina made him win even though I had the advantage.

This loss felt rough because I think I played it right, but he had that event in hand (that not a lot of decklists run), and he had it at the perfect timing.

## Round 2 - Black Teach ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went second.  
Had Stage, Burgess, Kuzan, and both my *Blackhole*s.

He did not have Stage.

## Round 3 - Blue Buggy ðŸ”´

Won dice, went second (I should have gone first).

Never played against a Buggy.  
Used leader effect on 5 Don, so he played his 10-cost Buggy.

From then on, I didnâ€™t use my leader effect, so he could spam the board with 5-cost characters.

Completely misplayed the matchupâ€”easy win for him.

## Round 4 - Black Smoker ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went second.

He played Koby to KO my 3-cost Shiryu, but I managed to get Shiryu back to clear his Koby as well.

Used leader effect on Don 7, because his Tashigi on 5 Don turn would have been worthless.

## Round 5 - Red/Green Smoker ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went first.

Mulliganed for Laboon, *Finger Pistol*, and Shiryu.  
Handled 2 of his Smokers.

On the last turn, instead of playing Teach, I focused on clearing board and almost lost because I had only 2 Life and no Blocker.

## Thoughts

I believe I played the Pluffy matchup perfectly, so I still canâ€™t understand how I lost. Maybe letting the 2-cost 7k Luffys stay on board was a mistake, and I shouldâ€™ve tried to kill one of them with a big swingâ€”but he had 8 cards in hand. I think Pluffy players know now how to handle the matchup : play big cost characters.

Laboons are essential against Smoker for my playstyle, so I definitely want to keep at least 2.
