# Bad management of leader effect

Reduced to 2 Laboons increased 2K counter Shiryu, 
*This is My Era*and *Blackhole* to 3.

## Round 1 - Green Yellow Yamato ðŸ”´

Lost dice, went first.

## Round 2 - Green Purple Lim ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went second.  

Trained the day before that matchup.

Had no stage and only one Teach on board and 0 in hand when he played 9 Cost Zoro.

Liberation + Finger pistol.
Stronger to -2 his 5 cost Dofla + Blackhole.
Chose to do a 15k to Zoro that he played rested with my Burgess which made me win.

## Round 3 - Yellow Kid ðŸ”´

Won dice, went second.

Never played against a Kid.  

I setup lethal on next turn with having 2 lifes and 2 Teach and a 2k counter in hand. Had the choice between thrashing a Teach or a 2K. Chose the 2K to trash which made him win because he did a 7k with his 0 power Shiraoshi and I had a single 2k that I got from my 2 Life. 

## Round 4 - Purple Luffy ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went second.

## Round 5 - Yellow Vegapunk ðŸŸ¢

Won dice, went second.

Went to extra time, I triggered Blackhole from life to negate his leader effect which allowed me to setup my Teach without pressure.
